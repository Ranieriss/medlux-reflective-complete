# Repository Review

## Scope Reviewed
- Branch: `work`
- Files present in repository root: `.gitkeep`

## Findings
1. No application source files, configuration files, tests, or documentation were found.
2. There is nothing substantive to perform a traditional code-quality, correctness, or security review on.

## Recommendations
1. Add a baseline project structure (for example, `src/`, `tests/`, and a `README.md`).
2. Add linting and test automation so future reviews can include objective validation.
3. Re-run review after initial implementation is committed.
